# VisualBoyAdvance-M Anylinux AppImage 🐧

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY OF THE BINARIES AND RUN THEM UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

NOTE: I am aware that there are built binaries out there but they (probably) lack the features I want on this emulator and that is why I'm building it from source

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

This AppImage can work **without FUSE** at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)
